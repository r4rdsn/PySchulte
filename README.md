# About
A Schulte table is a grid with randomly distributed numbers or letters used for development of speed reading, peripheral vision, attention and visual perception. You can find more information on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulte_table).
This program was developed on Python using Kivy GUI framework.


# History
The first version of PySchulte was developed as a request fulfillment for my friend's personal use back in March '17. So with his permission I decided to make it Open Source in case anyone would be interested in this.


# OS support
PySchulte primarily supports GNU/Linux and is tested on Arch Linux and Antegros. The first version was tested on Windows as a binary compiled using PyInstaller.


# License
PySchulte is distributed under the terms of GNU General Public License v3.
