# About
A Schulte table is a grid with randomly distributed numbers or letters used for development of speed reading, peripheral vision, attention and visual perception. You can find more information on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulte_table).  
PySchulte has such features as:  
* Timer that is tracking seconds of one training
* Time results are saved in a calendar sorted
* Limit on 10 trainings in one day
* Resizable table with side options from 3 to 9
* Resizable window to get the most comfortable size of table

The first version of PySchulte was developed as a request fulfillment for my friend's personal use back in March '17. So with his permission I decided to make it Open Source in case anyone would be interested in this.  
This program was developed on [Python](https://python.org/) using [Kivy GUI framework](https://github.com/kivy/kivy), [tinydb](https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb) and [KivyCalendar](https://bitbucket.org/xxblx/kivycalendar/).


# Installation
```$ git clone https://github.com/r4rdsn/PySchulte/```  
```$ cd PySchulte```   
```$ sudo python setup.py install```  
```$ sudo pip install .```  
After installation you should be able to run PySchulte in terminal by using ```pyschulte``` command. 


# OS support
PySchulte primarily supports GNU/Linux and is tested on Arch Linux and Antergos. The first version was tested on Windows as a binary compiled using PyInstaller, however it might be not relevant on further updates.
